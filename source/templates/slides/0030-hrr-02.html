            LenovoBelgium & Superette challenged us to create a good weird trophy for this year's winner of the public choice award at Humo's Rock Rally.
            After weeks of hacking, designing, brainstorming we made it happen, a hiding trophy which interacts with the winner's social media audience.</p>
